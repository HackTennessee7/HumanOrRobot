His smile was loud,
and me in my silence
I thought it was meant
for me. Momma warned
me about boys like him.
Told me that the kinds
of boys that shined a little
too bright might just be
trying to distract me from
the balled fists, the fury.
I was a fly and he lured
me straight into the light.
And oh how he burned
me, how he burned me.
